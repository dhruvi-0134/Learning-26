    A small kid who used to play in the local cricket teams to now the captain of Indian cricket team, the journey of self-assured, talented Virat Kohli is not only long but also quite inspiring. The Indian International Cricketer is known to be among the best batsman in the present era for his dependable and impressive batting style. He has managed to bring home many victorious awards single-handedly. His craze for cricket is not something new. He had keen interest and potential in this game at a quiet early age and took up the bat at the age of just 3 years.
